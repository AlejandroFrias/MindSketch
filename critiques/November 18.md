Critique for the Week of November 18th  
For Alejandro Frias  
By Jean Sung  

**What we talked about in class**

From class and from what I remember about your project, it seems like you are now working on the Sublime Text 2 Plugin  I remember about your project  it seems like you are now working on sublime text 2 plugin and writing it in Python and RegExs. In class, you showed some cool snippets for generating a Java style for loop. I wonder how much of a grammar this current version has / how much of it is really hardcorded. 

**Feedback from design notebook**

From your design notebook, I have some questions relating to your syntax. I am a bit unclear about the scope of your tool at this point - what are the commands that your tool will cover? How will you extend the capability? What does the AST look like? What will your prototype look like?

I agree that you are doing an external language. Also, I think it is a good idea because it could be more extensible for more target programming languages (like C++ or something more extreme). 

From last week, I see that you have added a diagram sketch of the architecture in your design and implementation document, this is really helpful showing your language. I would also suggest keeping the project repo's `README.md` file up to date, especially with the prototype that is due next week. 

**Feedback from design and implementation document**

I don't really understand the RegEx back end but otherwise it looks cool! I'm curious to see what kinds of prototypes you make!
