Critique for the Week of December 2nd  
For Alejandro Frias  
By Jean Sung  


### Feedback on installation & sampling process 
This week I was able to get build the files and get it to run which is really cool. The updated `README` file with step by step instructions, especially ones that listed what was necessary to have a little bit more in depth explanation was very helpful for me. I liked the idea of a screen recording that walks you through the examples and I think it is even easier to use because you narrated what you were doing. Great job!.

**Here are some of the highlights of my experience:**

This was a good error wrapping for when I tried to enter the commands meant for Python (supported) in Plain Text mode (not supported. Helpful in why what was I expecting didn't happen.

###Design notebook feedback 
I did the installing/ test run of your program as requested. Looks good to me. See below for comments on that. To answer your question, yes, this week's version is so much easier and better to use (because as you mentioned, you beefed up the documentation), and it's great. I love it as a programmer. I had one question - I noticed some parts where you said "if x otherwise y," and I was wondering why not directly go to "if else" because if this tool is aimed at programmers, the `if else` control flow logic is pretty common and usually pretty language independent. 

When you mention that "only lower case words are allowed, and no apostrophes. I want to change that, but it makes parsing more difficult." - if it's too difficult or really, if it is not immediately easy, I would save that for a future to do past this project. I didn't think it was too much of a hassle. 

A suggestion from what we talked about in class - it would be cool if you could save the commands you typed in. The biggest feature of what you have created is its language translation capability - because the English pseudocode outlines the same, language independent algorithm, it would be cool to be able to see the Python, Java, etc version without retyping the commands. This could be useful if you were using this tool in Python but then halfway realized that Java might be a better language or even that you wanted to support Java too.
