Critique for the Week of December 9th  
For Alejandro Frias   
By Jean Sung  

**Quick note**  
*links in markdown are [text to show](link!), meaning brackets first then parentheses

**General feedback**   
Make sure that you are looking at the final rendered version of the markdown file for formatting and spelling mistakes. They are a little bit distracting to your otherwise pretty good content and that is a shame. I use Macdown, which is a markdown editor for MacOSX with live updating and I recommend it.

You do have some error handling, be sure to mention the specific cases- like when you try to use Mindsketch for a language that is not supported (like plain text or javascript) and it's actually a pretty good one. 

Give yourself credit for how far you came, especially in the relatively shorter time span of when you actually did the code (a few weeks in). For a half semester scoped dream, you pretty much did it. 

Also, what are some of the other text editors you have in mind for supporting? Sublime is the only one I know which the capability to do what you described, i.e. plugins. 


**Didn't see an answer for these questions:** 
* How does the syntax of your language help users write programmers more easily than the syntax of a general-purpose language?
* Are there any other DSLs for this domain? If so, what are they, and how does your language compare to these other languages? (I didn't see as much comparison and be specific)
* In addition, I might take a look at the evaluation questions and answer them more directly, though I think your content covers a lot already. 
 

But pretty good overall. Just like you said, this week is a feature freeze and just add in the screen shots and diagrams.
