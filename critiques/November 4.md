**What are one or more things that you like about this project? What's exciting?** 
The novel nature of this idea is very cool! I looked around and didn't really find anything similar online. It also has the potential to be very useful because I could see myself using such a tool. Of course, there are also cool applications for accessibility for people who may not be able to program by more traditional typing methods. 

**What's the balance of language design vs sheer programming / engineering in this project?**  
This project's plan seems to have a lot of engineering and programming, at least based on the steps as outlined in the plan.md file. There is a lot of time allocated for steps 4, 5, 6, which are all focused on adding capabilities and test suites. 


**How can the project maximize the time spent on language design?How to focus on interesting, possibly new ideas?**  
The project could be structured to allow more time for flushing out the design, i.e. allocation more time on the design rather than the implementation. This could mean flushing out the theoretical more, if you want. 


**What are some interesting language design questions that the work will have to answer? In other words, what are the design challenges? Which design problems' solutions are you looking forward to hearing about at the end of the project?**  
The design challenges that I forsee are the same ones that you outlined, namely how to distinguish user defined commands and functions. Especially difficult is determine where to put the cursor, and how to deal with editing (how would the input look like to edit existing code). It's definitely a very ambitious project! I am looking forward to hear how you can edit existing code, i.e the refactoring feature. 

**What are the primitives in this language?**  
It seems like the primitives in this language are the things you can build up from, so the basic commands, like creating a new function or class. 

**Do you know of any libraries, languages, or projects that might help this project?**  
I didn't get any language preferences or leanings from reading the description.md file or the plan.md file. I know that there are resources for speech to text, so make sure not to reimplement that. Here is a suggestion for [python](https://code.google.com/p/pyspeech/), [scala](http://www.speechlang.org/files/userguide.pdf), [C#](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/380027/Csharp-Speech-to-Text), or maybe [Java](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13667731/api-for-speech-to-text-conversion). 


## Design notebook feedback: 
Unfortunately, it looks like you didn't fill out the design notebook for the week ending November 2nd, so I can't help you there :(

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a team, how did you share the labor?**
