Critique for the Week of November 11th  
For Alejandro Frias  
By Jean Sung 


**What we talked about in class**

From class, you said you were doing feasibility research and focusing on translating the text to Java. I want to see next week a more specific detailing of what you are focusing on. 

It might be a cool idea to explore helping set up template code or using a class interface definition to generate some templates for the implementation code. 



**Feedback from design notebook**

I definitely think you could go into a bit more research but the Xtext with Xtend sounds like a viable option. I would encourage you to start getting a rough prototype up and running, even if it is very limited in its functionality.

It also seems like you are moving toward a DSL for creating the plugin commands that move the cursor and paste in snippets or templates. I think this would be a reasonable size scope to start with, as it it is a much more narrow subset of things. 

I think if you are tailoring this programming language tool to those who are programmers, it is a perfectly fine thing to do to have English commands for things you do when writing code. I would actually almost expect it. Words like for, goto, if, else while, I would only use as keywords so it would work to make them special words.
