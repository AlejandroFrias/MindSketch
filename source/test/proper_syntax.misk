# Comments for the Translator Object

#    Should handle multiple lines and preserve spacing
# An be parsable even with lines seperating them

Title should handle spaces and Numbers23:


# Parser Objects should get comments
PARSER START
words to parse y and $START and $END
PARSER END

# As well as Code Snippets

#    And the multi-line thing

CODE START: java
for(int i = ${1:$START}; i < ${2:$END}; i++) {
    $0
}
CODE END

# Multiple Translator Objects should be able to be parsed
# And they can have the same name without overwriting parsers
# But it could overwrite code snippets or add to them depending on 
# the language of the snippet
Title should handle spaces and Numbers23:

PARSER START 
whatever (i|do)? $START and $END
PARSER END

CODE START: python
for x in xrange(${1:$START}, ${2:$END}):
    ${0:pass}
CODE END
